#JavaScript Learning Tests

A project to help me learn, explore and practice javascript and unit testing

The project uses Mocha, Chai and Sinon and can be run in the browser or with Karma.

##To Run the tests in a browser
Open app/index.html in your browser of choice

##To Run the tests from the command line

    npm install
    ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start karma.conf.js

The Karma server will run on port 9877 and will automatically run the tests in Chrome, Safari and PhantomJS
http://localhost:9877/

When the Karma server is running you can also view the Mocha html reporter in the browser
http://localhost:9877/
